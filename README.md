# BinaryTreeGraphics

A BST/RBT visualizer, the Stroudonian way.

## Input files
exampletree.in:
```
rbt
insert
45 23 12 21 34 98
delete
23 12 98
```
- Your input file should always be a ".in" file
- Start your file with either "rbt" or "bin"
- This visualizer supports two commands: `insert` and `delete`
- Both commands should be proceeded by a space-divided list of integers
- I'm not sure if duplicates work
